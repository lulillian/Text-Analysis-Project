# Text-Analysis-Project
 
Please read the [instructions](instructions.md).

## Project Overview
For this project, I used **IMDB** as my data source. I chose Scream 6 as the movie of my choice, and used python to analyze the reviews that were on said on the movie. I  characterized the words by word frequencies, used NLTK to remove stop words as well as to perform a sensitvity analysis on the words.I also averaged the ratings that were submitted. Through this project, I hoped to create something that can extract any movie from **IMDB**, and produce an output that would give me a good idea on how the movie was. I learned a lot throughout this process, such as how to efficiently utlize lists and dictionaries.

## Implementation
To start, I knew that I had to extract the data first from **IMDB**, something I have never done before. I utilized the resources in the instructions and imported the data dictionary. I knew that I wanted to analyze every word used for the reviews, so I wrote a function to turn all the words into one string for easier manipulation. During this, I stripped everything that was unnecessary, like puncations, numbers, and even removed *stop words* ![Screenshot of my chat with ChatGPT.](https://github.com/lulillian/Text-Analysis-Project/blob/main/images/chatgpt_stopwords.PNG) that would not be helpful. After removing the fluff, I knew that word frequencies were not enough to tell me how the movie was. I decided to find the average rating based on the given ratings in the review. I wanted to implement another new way to get a "feel" of a movie. This is when I utilized ChatGPT for other alternatives.

I thought about Word cloud analysis but felt that it would yield nothing of value, since I already did word frequencies. This is when ChatGPT offered another idea: *Sentiment Analysis*. ![Screenshot of my chat with ChatGPT.](https://github.com/lulillian/Text-Analysis-Project/blob/main/images/sentiment_chatgpt.PNG) After seeing how it was used, I tried it with my code. I used simple if statements to print "positive" or "negative" based on the score that was calculated.            

## Results
Performing the text analysis easily gave me a sense of how a certain movie was perceived. Take Scream 6 for instance. From performing a frequency test, and ouputing the top 20 words, you can tell that most people thought it was good. "Like", "good", "original", "best" were repeatedly used. The average rating was 6.84, not too high, or too low. However, from using a  sentiment analysis, 12.7 % of the reviews were negative, 68% neutral, and 19.4% were postive, resulting in a compounded score of 1. Meaning that it was overall perceived very positively. ![Scream 6.](https://github.com/lulillian/Text-Analysis-Project/blob/main/images/scream_resultsfinal.PNG).

The code was also applicable to any other movie listed on IMDB. For example, I ran it on the movie: Cats. A movie that is reputably known to be absolutely terribe. From the word frequency tests, the top 20 words returned were: "bad", "good"," new",etc. The average rating was 2.12. However the sentiment analysis showed that of all the reviews, 12.3% were negative, 74.7% were neatral, and 13% were positive resulting with a compounded score of 0.9743, which returned a rather positive rating, something that is rather inconsistent.

## Reflection
From a process point of view, many things went well. My backgound in knowing how to access dictionaries and lists helped me extract the exact information I wanted. Having done the exercises on word frequencies with the Pride and Prejudice Text really helped me understand how to remove stop words and strip unnecessary components of the text like numbers and punctuations.ChatGPT was able to help me perform those processes in simpler ways. However, I think there are some things that could be improved, such as the sentiment analysis being performed. For the Cats movie example, the inconsistent message I got from the common words, average rating, and sentiment score made me wonder how I could close that gap and make all the outputs more accurate. From some outside research, it seems that the sentiment analysis is a very complex process that involves various NLP and machine learning techniques, something outside the range of this class. Nevertheless, this project helped me conquer my fear of programming, as I was able to overcome challenges and produce something of value. It was an overall really fun process and has encouraged me to keep learning, especially on my own.
